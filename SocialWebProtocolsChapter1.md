## 1. Introduction

The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Social Web Working Group ran from June 2014 to December 2017, published seven recommendations and some notes. This is one of the notes, and it describes the work at the time of the group closing.

This work is by no means done, and the various communities involved have by no means gone to sleep. The endeavour continues in the [Social Web Community Group](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG), in which you are warmly invited to particiate.
